My first poker game development. This will be tested as a C program after Java
program has been completed.

Completed:
-simulates one whole turn (without betting)
-sorts deck and distributes 2 cards to each player and 5 cards to the Community Cards
-set blinds and dealer to players
-deal all 5 community cards (all at once at the moment)
-scores the 5 community cards

To do:
-include player hand scoring to community cards
-set up the rounds (betting round, dealing the flop/river/turn)
-distribute winnings after round

In development/planning:
poker server (Java based) with client connections
